# Classical_ML

Welcome to **Classical_ML**! 🚀  

This repository is my personal journey of strengthening my machine learning foundation. Here, I focus on:  

- **Fixing my beliefs** about ML concepts and building a strong mental model.  
- **Adding practicality** to theoretical knowledge through hands-on projects.  
- **Experimenting and creating projects** to reinforce learning.  

## What You Will Find Here

- **Supervised Learning:** Regression, Classification, and more.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, etc.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data patterns and insights.  
- **Time Series Analysis:** Forecasting and temporal data projects.  
- **Mini Projects & Practice:** Applying theory in real-world scenarios.  

## Why This Repo Exists

I believe that learning ML is not just about memorizing formulas or algorithms, but about **understanding concepts deeply and applying them practically**. This repo is my notebook, playground, and portfolio all in one.  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:  
   git clone https://github.com/Bishal-Stha/Classical_ML.git
