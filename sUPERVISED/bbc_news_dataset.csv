Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift,"The US will also offer “more limited” support to US allies, according to a new national defence strategy document.",,"The US will offer ""more limited"" support to its allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy. In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern. By comparison, previous versions of the defence strategy -  published once every four years - named the ""multi-domain threat"" posed by China as the top defence priority for the US. The new strategy reinforces recent comments made by US President Donald Trump, including calls for greater ""burden-sharing"" from US allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea. The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was ""largely consistent"" with its vision. By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described ""revisionist powers"", such as China and Russia, as the ""central challenge"" to US security. The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been ""content"" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards ""isolationism"". ""To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,"" it says. Washington has long neglected the ""concrete interests"" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests ""with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American."" Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, ""will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them"". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a ""persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members"". Relations with China are to be approached through ""strength, not confrontation"", the report says.  The goal ""is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them"". Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to ""prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies"". Late last year, the US announced avast arms sale to Taiwanworth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response. The strategy also outlines a ""more limited"" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is ""capable of taking primary responsibility"" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US hasseized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes againstalleged drug boatsin the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies toacquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon ""will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland"". The document says the Trump administration's approach will be ""fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations"". It adds: ""Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism."" At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had ""never gotten anything"" from Nato and ""we've never asked for anything"". He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming ""the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato"". Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is""not coming back""and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. ""Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,"" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a ""shift towards a world without rules"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9r8ezym3ro
Harry says sacrifices by Nato troops in Afghanistan deserve 'respect',"The US president's comments have been condemned by international allies, including UK veterans and politicians.",,"The Duke of Sussex has called for the sacrifices of Nato troops to be ""spoken about truthfully and with respect"", after the US president claimed allies stayed ""a little back"" from the front lines in Afghanistan. ""I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,"" Prince Harry, who was twice deployed to the country, said on Friday as he paid tribute to Nato troops killed in the conflict, including 457 UK service personnel. The prince was reacting to controversial comments made by Donald Trump in an interview on Thursday. Trump's words have drawn condemnation from international allies, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling them ""insulting and frankly appalling"" . The UK and other nations joined the US in Afghanistan after Nato's collective security clause was invoked following the 9/11 attacks. Prince Harry said: ""In 2001, Nato invoked Article 5 for the first - and only - time in history. It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call."" He added: ""Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. ""Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace."" The duke's comments follow Trump's Fox News interview in which he said: ""We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. ""They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines."" The president also said he was ""not sure"" the military alliance would be there for the US ""if we ever needed them"". In the UK, Trump's remarks were condemned across the UK's political divide. Shortly before the prince's statement, Sir Keir gave his own reaction saying if he himself had ""misspoken in that way"" he would ""certainly apologise"". Sir Keir said: ""I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country. ""There were many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries. ""I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country."" Outside the UK, ministers from foreign governments also criticised Trump's remarks. Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who was among 33,000 Polish troops who served on the frontline in Afghanistan, said: ""No one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers"". Canada's Minister of National Defence David J McGuinty said that Canadian ""men and women were on the ground from the beginning, not because we had to, but because it was the right thing to do."" He said 158 of their troops ""paid the ultimate price"" for leading allied efforts in the Kandahar Province. Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, former secretary general of Nato during the Afghanistan War, told the BBC World Service: ""No American president should have the liberty to belittle their legacy and to insult the ones who are still grieving the fact that they didn't come back alive from Afghanistan. ""What I would expect is a sincere apology from the president of the United States."" In October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers had died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which saw 2,461 fatalities. Most of the 457 British troops who died serving in Afghanistan over a period of nearly 20 years were killed in Helmand - the scene of the heaviest fighting. Hundreds more suffered injuries and lost limbs - including Cpl Andy Reid who lost both his legs and his right arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. ""Not a day goes by when we're not in some kind of pain, physically or mentally reflecting on that conflict,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Reid recalled working with American soldiers during his time in Afghanistan, adding: ""If they were on the front line and I was stood next to them, clearly we were on the front line as well."" Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered severe injuries when an Army Land Rover hit a mine near Musa Qala in 2006, said Trump's words were ""so insulting"" and hard to hear. The 41-year-old is currently recuperating after another operation, but Dernie told the BBC that Trump's comments showed ""a childish man trying to deflect from his own actions"". Dernie called on Starmer to ""stand up for his own armed forces"" and call out the US president. Her comments were put to the prime minister who replied: ""I've made my position clear, and what I say to Diane is, if I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologise and I'd apologise to her."" Giving a second interview to the BBC moments after Starmer's statement, Dernie said the prime minister's words were strong enough - but said he should go further. ""His words were exactly what we wanted to hear, but we need those words to be addressed directly to the president,"" Dernie said. ""I appreciate what Starmer has said, but they need to be said to Donald Trump."" Throughout Friday, the leaders of the main Westminster political parties gave their reaction to Trump's comments. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: ""I spoke to parents of young men who have lost their lives. It is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that. ""There is too much careless talk from President Trump. He clearly doesn't know the history of what happened. We must not have these sorts of throwaway remarks."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the US president's remarks and said: ""Trump avoided military service five times. How dare he question their sacrifice."" Trump received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: ""Donald Trump is wrong. For 20 years our armed forces fought bravely alongside America's in Afghanistan."" American political and military figures have also expressed their anger and frustration over Trump's Nato comments. Former national security adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster, who served as senior US officer in Afghanistan, said British forces were engaged in counter-insurgency operations every day. ""I think it's insulting to those who were fighting alongside of us,"" McMaster told the BBC. ""What I would like him to say is to make amends by affirming our gratitude for our allies who fought alongside us, and especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in a war that I think was important, obviously, to the future of all humanity."" During his second term in office, Trump has repeatedly criticised Nato, often accusing its member states of not spending enough on defence. In the last few weeks, Trump has made comments about acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato ally Denmark. Trump's repeated remarks over ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional European allies have rattled the transatlantic treaty. The White House has remained pretty quiet on the outrage being expressed in Britain - partly because the story has not played big in the US, and because Trump has been otherwise occupied, not making his usual appearances in front of cameras to have questions thrown at him. On Friday - before Starmer called on the US president to apologise - the White House released a statement sticking by Trump's long-held view on Nato. The White House said: ""President Trump is right – America's contributions to Nato dwarf that of other countries, and his success in delivering a 5% spending pledge from Nato allies is helping Europe take greater responsibility for its own defense. ""The United States is the only Nato partner who can protect Greenland, and the president is advancing Nato interests in doing so."" The White House is yet to comment on Starmer's suggestion for an apology.

Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks,Human-shark encounters in Australia are rising - but experts are keen to point out it isn't the animals' fault.,,"It's ""extraordinary"", says shark researcher Chris Pepin-Neff:four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15-kilometre stretch of Australia's east coast. On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition. Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer ""sustained a wound to his chest"" after a shark bit his board some 300km (186 miles) up the coast. ""This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,"" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney. The rapid spate of incidents triggered local and international alarm, with dozens of beaches closed amid fear of further attacks. Predictably, calls for shark culls have gathered momentum and volume. Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish. There are multiple factors that likely contributed to the recent spate of incidents, they say – and it's not the sharks that are the problem. Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both. The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127 millimetres of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years. That rainfall would have created ""perfect conditions"" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University. ""Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,"" she told the BBC. ""They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them."" Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks. ""There's clearly an attractant in the water,"" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a ""perfect storm"" of low salinity freshwater could have created a ""biodiversity explosion"". ""The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem."" Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards. That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors. These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer. ""The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,"" Pepin-Neff explains. They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites ""doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things"". Olive echoes this point, noting that ""given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common"". If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media. Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk. When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an ""attack"", the danger seems greater than it is. ""There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',"" they explain. ""And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened."" In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches. Experts reject the suggestion. ""I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,"" says Olive. Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack. ""It just doesn't work,"" they say. ""It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer."" In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area. ""It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in."" Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely. More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean. ""In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,"" says Pepin-Neff. ""Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild."" This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks. ""This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,"" they say. ""The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous. ""We're in the way, not on the menu.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0err023g5lo
Is China quietly winning the AI race?,"Chinese AI models are racing ahead of their American rivals as US firms big and small turn to cheaper, faster alternatives.",,"Every month, hundreds of millions of users flock to Pinterest looking for the latest styles. One page titled ""the most ridiculous things"" is filled with plenty of wacky ideas to inspire creatives. Crocs repurposed as flower pots. Cheeseburger-shaped eyeshadow. A gingerbread house made of vegetables. But what would-be buyers may not know is the tech behind this isn't necessarily US-made. Pinterest is experimenting with Chinese AI models to hone its recommendation engine. ""We've effectively made Pinterest an AI-powered shopping assistant,"" the firm's boss Bill Ready told me. Of course, the San Francisco-based tastemaker could use any number of American AI labs to power things behind-the-scenes. But since the launch of China's DeepSeek R-1 model in January 2025, Chinese AI tech has increasingly been a part of Pinterest. Ready calls the so-called ""DeepSeek moment"" a breakthrough. ""They chose to open source it, and that sparked a wave of open source models,"" he said. Chinese competitors include Alibaba's Qwen and Moonshot's Kimi, while TikTok owner ByteDance is also working on similar technology. Pinterest Chief Technology Officer Matt Madrigal said the strength of these models is that they can be freely downloaded and customised by companies like his - which is not the case with the majority of models offered by US rivals like OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. ""Open source techniques that we use to train our own in-house models are 30% more accurate than the leading off-the-shelf models,"" Madrigal said. And those improved recommendations come at a much lower cost, he said, sometimes ninety percent less than using the proprietary models favoured by US AI developers. Pinterest is hardly the only US enterprise depending on AI tech from China. These models are gaining traction across an array of Fortune 500 companies. Airbnb boss Brian Chesky told Bloomberg in October his company relied ""a lot"" on Alibaba's Qwen to power its AI customer service agent. He gave three simple reasons - it's ""very good"", ""fast"" and ""cheap"". Further evidence can be found on Hugging Face, the place people go to download ready-made AI models - including from major developers Meta and Alibaba. Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the platform, said it is the cost factor that leads young start-ups to look at Chinese models over their US counterparts. ""If you look at the top trending models on Hugging Face - the ones that are most downloaded and liked by the community - typically, Chinese models from Chinese labs occupy many of the top 10 spots,"" he told me. ""There are weeks where four out of five top training models on Hugging Face are from Chinese labs."" In September, Qwen topped Meta's Llama to become the most downloaded family of large language models on the Hugging Face platform. Metareleasedits open-source Llama AI models in 2023. Up until the release of DeepSeek and Alibaba's models, they were considered the go-to choice for developers working on bespoke applications. But the release of Llama 4 last year left developers underwhelmed, and Meta has reportedly been using open-source models with Alibaba, Google, and OpenAI to train a new model set for release this spring. Airbnb also uses several models, including US-based ones, hosting them securely in the company’s own infrastructure. The data is never provided to the developers of the AI models they use, according to the company. Going into 2025, the consensus was despite billions of dollars being spent by US tech firms, Chinese companies were threatening to pull ahead. ""That's not the story anymore,"" Boudier said. ""Now, the best model is an open-source model."" A report published last month by Stanford University found Chinese AI models ""seem to have caught up or even pulled ahead"" of their global counterparts - both in terms of what they're capable of, and how many people are using them. In a recent interview with the BBC, former UK deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg said he felt US firms were overly focused on the pursuit of AI which may one day surpass human intelligence. Last year, Sir Nick left his post as head of global affairs at Meta, the developer of Llama. Boss Mark Zuckerberg has committed billions of dollars to achieving what he calls ""superintelligence."" Some experts are now calling these ambitions vague and ill-defined – giving China an opening to dominate the open-source AI space. ""Here's the irony,"" Sir Nick said.In the battle between ""the world's great autocracy"" and ""the world's greatest democracy"" - China and America - China is ""doing more to democratise the technology they're competing over"". The Stanford report also suggested China's success in developing open-source models could be partly explained by government support. On the other side of the world, US companies like OpenAI are under intense pressure to increase revenue and become profitable -and is now turning to adsto help get there. The company released two open-source models last summer – its first in years. But it has poured most of its resources into proprietary models to help it make money. OpenAI boss Sam Altman told me in October it has invested aggressively into securing ever more computing power and infrastructure deals with partners. ""Revenue will grow super fast, but you should expect us to invest a ton in training, in the next model and the next and the next and the next,"" he said.

High stakes but low expectations for Ukraine talks with Russia and US,"Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal - but major issues between Russia and Ukraine are still unresolved, writes Sarah Rainsford.",,"Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for their first trilateral talks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same. The stakes are high, but expectations are limited. Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be ""stupid"" if they couldn't agree. But despitesome intense shuttle diplomacyby his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks involving Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved. Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid. Now, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were ""really positive"" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result. Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat. But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates. He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as ""a step"", but shied away from calling it a positive one. ""We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace,"" is how he put it. For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing. ""It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet,"" he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains. Russia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses. Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it. Zelensky can't cross it. As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street. On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove past so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags. The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its ""security guarantees"", and says are essential. Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details. Russia's response also remains a wide-open question. There's also the giant new doubt about how good a guarantee from Donald Trump really is: the US president'sfixation on ""acquiring"" Greenlandhas severely undermined Nato. He's also undermined the very principle of protecting a nation's sovereignty, the whole basis for Western support for Ukraine. So can Kyiv trust him to come to the rescue in the next crisis? For now, it doesn't have much choice. As for trusting Vladimir Putin, no one here is under any illusions that his aims have changed. ""He really doesn't want it,"" is what Zelensky said in Davos about Putin and peace. The Kremlin has said that if it doesn't get what it wants at the talking table, it will ""achieve its aims on the battlefield"" - though it's failed so far, despite sacrificing a huge number of soldiers. So once again, it's targeting civilian infrastructure across the country - but in a more deliberate, sustained, and devastating way than ever before. In the depths of a bitter winter, that's left people freezing in their homes. Today, the mayor of Kyiv again called on city residents to leave if they have somewhere to go. ""The enemy will most likely continue to attack the critical infrastructure of the city and the country,"" Vitali Klitschko warned. After repeat attacks, the system is very fragile. ""I address the residents and say honestly: the situation is extremely difficult and this may not be the most difficult moment yet.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3edde1pwx8o

US braces for 'extremely dangerous' winter storm,"The National Weather Service warns the winter blast ""will pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia"".",,"More than 200 million Americans are expected to face an unusually brutal winter storm starting Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains forecast. The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States, leaving ""extremely dangerous"" conditions in its wake as it tracks eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and wind chills, which ""pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin"". US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and cancellations. The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow. Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast. According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West Virginia to Boston. Parts of northeast New Jersey and southeast New York, including New York City, could see between 10 and 14 inches of snow starting early on Sunday and lasting through Monday, the NWS predicts. And windchills as low as -10F (-23C) are expected for the same region from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon, the service says. Most of southern New England, including Boston, can expect between 12 and 17 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 30mph from Sunday into Monday, NWS says. Wind chill temperatures there could reach -15F (-26C) Friday into Saturday. Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F (-46C) across the Northern Plains. A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to experience freezing temperatures. Parts of North Texas were already seeing sleet and ice on Friday night. Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts. In a press conference on Friday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the state has over 1,600 snow plows and 114,000 tonnes of salt on hand for the storm, which she said will leave no corner of the state ""immune from feeling the effect of Mother Nature's wrath"". Hochul urged residents to work from home, stock up on groceries and essentials ahead of time and be careful when shoveling snow, which can increase the risk of a heart attack. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Friday the city will be deploying thousands of sanitation workers this weekend, 700 salt spreaders and 2,200 snow plows once two inches of snow have accumulated. While subways and buses will be operational this weekend, he urged New Yorkers to stay home if they can. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday there's ""no expectation whatsoever"" that the state's power grid will fail, as it did during a major storm in 2021 which led to hundreds of deaths in the state. There may be some local power outages due to falling ice and snow, he said, but stressed that this would be different from a large-scale grid failure. ""The local power providers have never been more prepared for any winter storm ever,"" Abbott said. In total, 16 states were under a state of emergency on Friday ahead of the storm. Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns about cancellations. More than 3,200 flights within, into or out of the US have already been cancelled for Saturday, as well as over 4,800 for Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel expected to be ""nearly impossible during the peak of the storm"", NWS meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC's US news partner CBS. Meanwhile in Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week. Even after the storm passes through the US this weekend, a strong arctic air mass originating in Canada will keep temperatures frigid in the eastern US into next week, according to the NWS Weather Prediction Center.

"Trump covets mineral-rich Greenland, but what natural resources does it actually have?",Greenland's natural resources include large reserves of rare earth deposits.,,"Donald Trump has made clear he covets Greenland. Now he claims to have secured the""framework"" of a future deal, to address defence on the island - a deal that he says includes rights to rare earth minerals. So what natural resources does Greenland have? Greenland is believed to sit on top of large reserves of oil and natural gas. It is also said to be home to the vast majority of raw materials considered crucial for electronics, green energy and other strategic and military technologies – to which Trump has been pushing to secure America's access. Overall, 25 of 34 minerals deemed ""critical raw materials"" by the European Commission are found in Greenland, including graphite, niobium and titanium, according to the 2023 Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Greenland's strategic importance is ""not just about defence"", Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said at a Senate hearing last year about the potential acquisition of Greenland, pointing to the island's ""vast reserves of rare earth elements"". Trump has sometimes downplayed the importance of those resources, pointing to what he claims is rising Russian and Chinese influence in the region to justify his claims that the US has to ""have"" the island. ""I want Greenland for security - I don't want it for anything else,"" he told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, pointing in part to the difficulty of exploring in the Arctic region. ""You have to go 25ft down through ice to get it. It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do."" But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority. Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is ""primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access"", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic. Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority. ""This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,"" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year. And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a ""business president"" who believed the island represented ""a more robust trading opportunity"". Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China. Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to ""shift the dial"" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration. But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done. Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said. While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland. ""Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,"" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies. ""It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals."" But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff. ""Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,"" he told the BBC. ""With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect."" Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, ""it's all still about potential"". Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. ""His logic is that there's a national security imperative,"" Spence said. ""My belief is that this is much more economically driven.""

How 'lucky' Sinner became biggest winner in near 40C Melbourne heat,Jannik Sinner's hopes of a third straight Australian Open title looked close to being over - then he benefitted from the heat creeping towards 40C.,,"Jannik Sinner's ambitions of winning a third straight Australian Open title looked close to being over as the Melbourne heat crept towards 40C. In the end, the rising temperatures helped the cramping Italian come through a testing third-round match - because the Grand Slam tournament's heat rule was invoked. Only coming off court and having the roof pulled over saved Sinner from a shock defeat by American world number 85 Eliot Spizzirri. ""I got lucky with the heat rule,"" conceded Sinner, who came through to win 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-4. Sinner was undoubtedly the biggest winner on a sweltering day where play was suspended and almost 100,000 fans were warned to take care in the heat. Matches on the show courts are being played in cooler conditions under the roof, but there is no play on the outside courts because of the heat. Mist tunnels, water machines and sun umbrellas helped cool down spectators. Ball kids placed their hands on their feet  - instead of the court - to avoid burning their palms when crouching at the net post. American player Jessica Pegula says the stars are ""used to"" the searing heat, but Saturday's conditions were a reminder of how brutal it can be at Melbourne Park. Play is stopped at the Australian Open when theheat stress scalehits its maximum of five. The tournament's heat stress scale measures four factors: radiant heat (or the strength of the sun), air temperature in the shade, relative humidity and wind speed. Matches on the show courts stop at the end of an even game in order for the roof to be closed and allow the air circulation system to cool the court. When Sinner and Spizzirri took to court at about 12:30 for the second match on Laver, chair umpire Fergus Murphy reminded the players about the protocols which could be enforced. With the match level at one set all, Sinner could barely walk at the start of the third set and fell a break down at 3-1. Then came a huge slice of fortune in a moment of sporting theatre. Seconds after the fourth game, with Sinner looking finished, the Australian Open's heat stress scale hit five - meaning the top seed was able to go off court. It was a pivotal moment in the momentum of the match. There is no question the heat rule benefitted the red-headed Sinner, who has a history of struggling to cope with the heat and immediately limped to the locker room. Spizzirri looked bemused as he shook his head. But the rules were implemented correctly. Sinner broke back immediately after an eight-minute delay while the roof on Rod Laver Arena was closed as per the ruling. While still moving tentatively, a calmer Sinner took Spizzirri's serve again for 5-4 and secured the third set before going on to secure a dramatic victory. The temperature dropped to about 26C during the fourth set of Sinner's match. Sinner now looked much more comfortable in his movement, even though he often stayed stood at the change of ends, and his ball-striking became too much for Spizzirri to handle. A puff of his cheeks on his way to the net indicated Sinner's relief. Tournament organisers brought Saturday's play forward by 30 minutes in anticipation of the searing temperatures hitting Melbourne. Play began on all courts at 10:30 local time (23:30 GMT) instead of the usual 11:00 start. It always looked likely the action would be suspended in the afternoon, given the Australian Bureau of Meteorology had issued a severe heatwave warning. British junior Hollie Smart was among the early starters and had to retire from her first-round match after also suffering cramp. Defending women's champion Madison Keys and her fellow American Pegula were pleased to come through their early matches unscathed. ""I'm super happy to be able to get out there before the heat got extreme. Just get in and get out early,"" said Keys, who won 6-3 6-3 against Czech Karolina Pliskova. Pegula, who won 6-3 6-2 against Russia's Oksana Selekhmeteva, said the conditions were ""different but not crazy"". ""I think we're all used to it. I think I would much rather have played first and hopefully won efficiently enough to kind of get out of that heat as quick as possible,"" she added. Ball boys and girls will work 45-minute rotations instead of the usual one hour, with an increased one-and-a-half-hour break between shifts. Fans were reminded to stay vigilant and take precautions. Another 100,000-strong crowd was expected at Melbourne Park for Saturday's third-round matches. The Australian Open says the facilities throughout the site will help people cool down, including: 46 water bubblers/refill stations 56 water misting fans and two high-powered typhoon misters Hydration stations at every entrance Staff offering water in queues 9,000sqm of additional shade coverage Temperatures are also predicted to top 40C on Tuesday, when the singles quarter-finals are scheduled to begin. ""The weather being crazy [means] a lot of adjustment on the strings and your approach to the match,"" said women's world number one Aryna Sabalenka, who plays Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko in the fourth round on Sunday. ""It's going like a rollercoaster. We'll see who adjusts better in the next days.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c1ev96w4xv6o
Tesla fined for repeatedly failing to help UK police over driving offences,The British arm of Tesla has faced multiple court proceedings linked to allegations of road traffic offences.,,"Tesla has been convicted at least 18 times and ordered to pay more than £20,000 for repeatedly failing to co-operate with UK police forces. The British arm of Elon Musk's electric car giant has faced multiple criminal court proceedings over the past two years linked to alleged road traffic offences. Tesla offers its vehicles on long-term leases, and in such a scenario the leasing company is typically the registered keeper of the car. Drivers of rented or company cars caught speeding have to be named before they can face prosecution and companies which fail to return paperwork to police can be prosecuted instead. Almost 4,000 defendants have been convicted in courts in England and Wales in the last two weeks for failing to identify the driver of a vehicle under police investigation, leading to fines ranging from £1 to £1,000. In one incident, South Wales Police wrote to Tesla Financial Services in a bid to identify the driver of a Tesla which had been speeding at 80mph (128km/h) on the M4 near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in July 2025. Court papers show a Tesla company director, Becky Hodgson, pleaded guilty for the firm by email in late November, saying it had tried to enter the plea online but ""encountered a technical issue on the Online Plea Service portal"". Although the company admitted the criminal charge, Hodgson suggested in her email that it had complied with the police request, adding that its internal processes were followed and the nomination was sent via post. A conviction was handed out at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court on 6 January and ended in Tesla receiving a £1,000 fine, an order for £120 costs and a £400 victim surcharge. At least 18 convictions recorded against Tesla Financial Services have been identified by the Press Association since the start of 2024, including prosecutions brought by the Metropolitan Police, Hampshire Constabulary and Thames Valley Police. Seventeen cases have already been sentenced, while Tesla Financial Services pleaded guilty last week to failing to identify a driver. That case is set to be sentenced at a later date at Bath Magistrates' Court. In one of the concluded cases, a Tesla driver was caught on a speed camera doing almost 100mph (160km/h) on the A3 in Petersfield in Hampshire. But due to police letters going unanswered, the speeding driver was not identified and the company received a conviction with a fine instead. Another Tesla driver was caught speeding three times, potentially putting them on the cusp of a disqualification - if they had been identified. Letters from police which went unanswered have been addressed to Tesla Financial Services at offices and a service centre in London, as well as an office in Manchester. In the cases identified, fines, costs and court fees totalling £20,686 have been imposed by magistrates sitting in the single justice procedure, which deals with minor offences. Tesla have been asked to comment.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r44zpprg7o
Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline,"A stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say.",,"A stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say. It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination. The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain. The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue. Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there. Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science. Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done. Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery,published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved. ""When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain"". The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University. ""We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years"". The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock. One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world. Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say. After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is ""a very us thing to do"". He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method. Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region. Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed ""hundreds of new rock art sites"" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years. Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived. For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN). ""It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia."" Many archaeologists once argued for a European ""big bang"" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before. Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News. ""What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that"".

Brooklyn Beckham's wedding DJ speaks about 'awkward' dance,"The groom has said his mother Victoria ""danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone"".",,"Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's wedding DJ has given his account of what happened during what he describes as an ""awkward"" dance between the groom and his mother Victoria. On Monday, Brooklyn almost broke the internet byposting a series of claimsabout his famous parents, Sir David and Lady Beckham, including that his mother hijacked his first dance withactress and hedge fund heiress Nicola Peltz. He claimed his mum, formerly one of the Spice Girls, had ""danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone"", leaving him feeling ""uncomfortable"" and ""humiliated"". DJ Fat Tony said ""the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room"". After rampant speculation over Brooklyn's comment about his mother's dancing, the DJ said: ""There was no slutdropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action."" Pop star Marc Anthony performed at the wedding reception and called Brooklyn on to the stage, the DJ, whose real name is Tony Marnoch, told ITV's This Morning on Friday. ""The next minute, everyone was expecting it to be Nicola to go up and do the first dance,"" he said. The US singer then called for ""the most beautiful woman in the room"" to join Brooklyn - before saying Victoria's name instead of Nicola's,"" Marnoch claimed. This led to the bride running out of the room in tears, he added. ""Victoria is by the stage, she goes onto the stage, and of course at that point Brooklyn is suddenly, literally, devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife. ""Then Nicola leaves the room crying her eyes out. Brooklyn is stuck there on stage. ""And then they do this dance and Marc Anthony's going, 'Put your hands on your mother's hips'. It was a Latin thing. ""The whole situation was very awkward for everyone in the room."" However, his account differs from other reports, some of which have said the first dance took place between Brooklyn and Nicola earlier, before Anthony's performance began. British Vogue, who were at the wedding, said Anthony appeared at 11pm and that it was Brooklyn who ""invited his mother on stage for a dance"". BBC News has contacted Anthony, who is a singer-songwriter and friend of the Beckhams, for a comment. Sir David and Lady Beckham have not directly responded to Brooklyn's post or given their side of the story. Marnoch has DJ'd at ""an awful lot of Beckham parties in the past"", and they are a ""close-knit family"" who ""love to dance"", he said. Whether that dance was ""inappropriate"" is down to how Brooklyn feels, he said. ""This is all about how Brooklyn feels. If he feels that it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward."" The following day's brunch was ""the most awkward part of it all"" because ""everything that had gone on at the wedding night was discussed amongst the guests the next morning"", the DJ said. He added that the newlyweds left ""devastated"", but said the dance ""is a very small part of a bigger problem"" for the feuding family. It's ""sad"" that many people have focused on that part of Brooklyn's statement, Marnoch said. Mock-ups and memes of Lady Beckham's supposed wedding dance have been flooding the internet all week. ""It's taken a lot for someone to go to social media to post it,"" he added. ""He wanted to change the narrative. For all of his life he's been called a nepo baby, and 'He should be grateful that he's got the family name'. ""That's what he was born into. I think what we're all missing here is the fact that parents have lost their child, and a son's lost his parents and the rest of his family."" In his explosive Instagram post on Monday,Brooklyn said he did not want to ""reconcile"" with his family, citing further wedding dress drama and an accusation that his parents put ""brand Beckham"" first.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8220err46o
