# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---

## 🟦 **1. Context**


* Understand what the dataset represents and the objective
* Inspect dataset size, columns, data types, and roles

---

## 🟦 **2. Quality Check**

* Identify missing values and duplicates
* Detect invalid, inconsistent, or out-of-range entries

---

## 🟦 **3. Analysis of Variables**

* Study distributions of numerical and categorical variables
* Analyze target variable type, distribution, and imbalance

---

## 🟦 **4. Relationships**

* Examine feature–feature and feature–target relationships
* Identify correlation, redundancy, and leakage risks

---

## 🟦 **5. Time Effects & Modeling Readiness**

* Detect trends, seasonality, or temporal changes (if applicable)
* Prepare data for modeling through scaling, encoding, and feature selection

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**

EDA is a systematic process to understand data **structure, quality, behavior, and relationships**, enabling effective and trustworthy modeling.
